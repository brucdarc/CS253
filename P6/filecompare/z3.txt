I noticed there are some special symbol/characters in some of the files, i.e., Ωmega 1.39794, æ 0.69897, əl 0.69897, §2 1.39794, etc.  
Which I included the corresponding TFIDF for as well.  @167 test3 has the same issue with there being a special character in "that�s". 
Maybe these strings are parsed differently in your program?
Not sure what would be different, being all the other test cases match.

Thank you for sharing these!
