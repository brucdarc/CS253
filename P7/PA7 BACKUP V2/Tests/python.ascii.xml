'''Python''' is a [[Measuring programming language popularity|widely used]] [[high-level programming language]] for [[general-purpose programming language|general-purpose programming]], created by [[Guido van Rossum]] and first released in 1991. An [[interpreted language]], Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code [[readability]] (notably using [[whitespace character|whitespace]] indentation to delimit [[code block]]s rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer [[source lines of code|lines of code]] than might be used in languages such as [[C++]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Summerfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt |last=Summerfield |first=Mark |quote=Python is a very expressive language, which means that we can usually write far fewer lines of Python code than would be required for an equivalent application written in, say, C++ or Java}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JfE7TGUwvgC&amp;pg=PT100 |title=Code Complete, p. 100|isbn=9780735636972|last1=McConnell|first1=Steve |date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-7&quot; /&gt;

Python features a [[dynamic type]] system and automatic [[memory management]] and supports multiple [[programming paradigm]]s, including [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[imperative programming|imperative]], [[functional programming]], and [[procedural programming|procedural]] styles. It has a large and comprehensive [[standard library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!-- need at least a paragraph here on history and development
 --&gt;
Python interpreters are available for many [[operating system]]s, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. [[CPython]], the [[reference implementation]] of Python, is [[open source]] software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/3/license.html |title=History and License |accessdate=5 December 2016}} &quot;All Python releases are Open Source&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit [[Python Software Foundation]].

== History ==
[[File:Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Guido van Rossum]], the creator of Python]]
{{Main article|History of Python}}

Python was conceived in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;venners-interview-pt-1&quot; /&gt; and its implementation began in December 1989&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline-of-python&quot; /&gt; by [[Guido van Rossum]] at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica]] (CWI) in the [[Netherlands]] as a successor to the [[ABC (programming language)|ABC language]] (itself inspired by [[SETL]])&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-12&quot; /&gt; capable of [[exception handling]] and interfacing with the operating system [[Amoeba (operating system)|Amoeba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-created&quot; /&gt; Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, ''[[Benevolent Dictator For Life]]'' (BDFL).

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/ |title=Foreword for &quot;Programming Python&quot; (1st ed.) |last=van Rossum |first=Guido |date=1996 |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a &quot;hobby&quot; programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]] that would appeal to [[Unix]]/[[C (programming language)|C]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'').}}

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a [[Cycle detection|cycle-detecting]] [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] and support for [[Unicode]]. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newin-2.0&quot; /&gt;

Python 3.0 (that early in its development was commonly referred to as Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backward-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0-release&quot; /&gt; after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been [[backporting|backported]] to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6.x&lt;ref name=&quot;pep-3000&quot; /&gt; and 2.7.x version series.

The End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code cannot easily be forward-ported to Python 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/ |title=PEP 373 -- Python 2.7 Release Schedule |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/ |title=PEP 466 -- Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7.x |work=python.org |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to [[Go (programming language)|Go]] [[transcompiler]], which [[The Register]] speculated was in response to Python 2.7's planned end-of-life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/05/googles_grumpy_makes_python_go/ |title=Google's Grumpy code makes Python Go |first=Thomas |last=Claburn |date=5 January 2017 |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html |title=Google Open Source Blog: Grumpy: Go running Python! |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and philosophy ==
Python is a [[multi-paradigm programming language]]: [[object-oriented programming]] and [[structured programming]] are fully supported, and many language features support [[functional programming]] and [[aspect-oriented programming]] (including by [[metaprogramming]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-13&quot; /&gt; and [[metaobject]]s (magic methods)).&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-14&quot; /&gt; Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including [[design by contract]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-16&quot; /&gt; and [[logic programming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-17&quot; /&gt;

Python uses [[dynamic typing]] and a mix of [[reference counting]] and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for [[memory management]]. An important feature of Python is dynamic [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]] ([[late binding]]), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

The design of Python offers some support for [[functional programming]] in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] tradition. The language has &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; functions; [[list comprehension]]s, [[Associative array|dictionaries]], and sets; and [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] expressions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-59&quot;/&gt; The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Standard ML]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-18&quot; /&gt;

The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document ''The [[Zen of Python]]'' (''PEP 20''), which includes [[aphorism]]s such as:&lt;ref name=&quot;PEP20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- Note this isn't a full list, just some of the more significant aphorisms --&gt;
* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language's core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], which espoused the opposite mindset.&lt;ref name=&quot;venners-interview-pt-1&quot; /&gt;

While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax, such as in [[Perl]], in favor of a sparser, less-cluttered grammar. As [[Alex Martelli]] put it: &quot;To describe something as clever is ''not'' considered a compliment in the Python culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-19&quot; /&gt; Python's philosophy rejects the Perl &quot;[[there is more than one way to do it]]&quot; approach to language design in favor of &quot;there should be one--and preferably only one--obvious way to do it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PEP20&quot; /&gt;

Python's developers strive to avoid [[premature optimization]], and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal increase in speed at the cost of clarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-20&quot; /&gt; When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using [[PyPy]], a [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]]. [[Cython]] is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

An important goal of Python's developers is making it fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name, which comes from [[Monty Python]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python |title=General Python FAQ - Why is it called Python?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard [[Foobar|foo and bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetech.monster.com/training/articles/8114-15-ways-python-is-a-powerful-force-on-the-web |title=15 Ways Python Is a Powerful Force on the Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html |title=pprint - Data pretty printer - Python Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common [[neologism]] in the Python community is ''pythonic'', which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ''unpythonic''.

Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as ''Pythonists'', ''Pythonistas'', and ''Pythoneers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-25&quot; /&gt;

== Syntax and semantics ==
{{Main article|Python syntax and semantics}}

Python is intended to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, often using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional, in contrast to many other programming languages. Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-52&quot; /&gt;

=== Indentation ===
{{Main article|Python syntax and semantics#Indentation}}

Python uses [[whitespace character|whitespace]] indentation to delimit [[block (programming)|blocks]] - rather than [[curly bracket programming language|curly braces]] or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-53&quot; /&gt; This feature is also sometimes termed the [[off-side rule]].

=== Statements and control flow ===
Python's [[Statement (computer science)|statements]] include (among others):

* The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional [[imperative programming]] languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of ''variables'') illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in [[C (programming language)|C]], e.g., &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;, translates to &quot;typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2&quot;. The (right-hand) value is copied into an [[Memory management#ALLOCATION|allocated storage location]] for which the (left-hand) [[Variable (computer science)|variable name]] is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared [[Type system|type]]. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;, translates to &quot;(generic) name x receives a [[Pointer (computer programming)|reference]] to a separate, dynamically allocated [[Object (computer science)|object]] of numeric (int) type of value 2.&quot; This is termed ''binding'' the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't ''contain'' the indicated value, it is improper to call it a ''variable''. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., &lt;code&gt;x = 2&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;y = 2&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;z = 2&lt;/code&gt; result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed [[Type system|data type]] with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to ''some'' object, which '''will''' have a type; thus there is [[Dynamic type|dynamic typing]].
* The &lt;code&gt;[[if-then-else|if]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; (a contraction of else-if).
* The &lt;code&gt;[[Foreach#Python|for]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[While loop#Python|while]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[Exception handling syntax#Python|try]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
* The &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a [[class (computer science)|class]], for use in [[object-oriented programming]].
* The &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; statement, which defines a [[function (computing)|function]] or [[method (computing)|method]].
* The &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement (from Python 2.5), which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a [[lock (computer science)|lock]] before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a [[Computer file|file]] and then closing it), allowing [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization]] (RAII)-like behavior.
* The &lt;code&gt;pass&lt;/code&gt; statement, which serves as a [[NOP]]. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
* The &lt;code&gt;[[assertion (programming)|assert]]&lt;/code&gt; statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
* The &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statement, which returns a value from a [[generator (computer science)#Python|generator]] function. From Python 2.5, &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is also an operator. This form is used to implement [[coroutine]]s.
* The &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.There are two ways of using import . from &lt;module name&gt; import *   or import &lt;module name&gt;.
* The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement was changed to the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function in Python 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;diff_py2-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweigart |first=Al|year=2010|chapter=Appendix A: Differences Between Python 2 and 3 |title=Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python |url=http://inventwithpython.com/appendixa.html|edition=2|isbn=978-0-9821060-1-3 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python does not support [[tail call]] optimization or [[first-class continuations]], and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-55&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-56&quot; /&gt; However, better support for [[coroutine]]-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's [[generator (computer science)|generators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-57&quot; /&gt; Before 2.5, generators were [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] [[iterator]]s; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-58&quot; /&gt;

=== Expressions ===
Some Python [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] are similar to languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], while some are not:

* Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. Python also added the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator for exponentiation.
* From Python 3.5, it enables support of [[matrix multiplication]] with the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;ref name=PEP465&gt;{{cite web |title=PEP 0465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/|website=python.org |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Python3.5Changelog&gt;{{cite web |title=Python 3.5.1 Release and Changelog |url=https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/|website=python.org |accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Python, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21.1 |title=Chapter 15. Expressions - 15.21.1. Numerical Equality Operators == and != |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and objects by reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21.3 |title=Chapter 15. Expressions - 15.21.3. Reference Equality Operators == and != |publisher=Oracle Corporation |accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method.) Python's &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example &lt;code&gt;a &lt;= b &lt;= c&lt;/code&gt;. 
* Python uses the words &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; used in Java and C.
* Python has a type of expression termed a ''[[list comprehension#Python|list comprehension]]''. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a ''[[generator (computer science)|generator]] expression''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-59&quot; /&gt;
* [[Anonymous function]]s are implemented using [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expressions]]; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.
* Conditional expressions in Python are written as &lt;code&gt;x if c else y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-60&quot; /&gt; (different in order of operands from the &lt;code&gt;[[?:|c ? x : y]]&lt;/code&gt; operator common to many other languages).
* Python makes a distinction between [[list (computer science)|lists]] and [[tuple]]s. Lists are written as &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be [[immutable]] in Python). Tuples are written as &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; initially equal to &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt;, executing &lt;code&gt;t = t + (4, 5)&lt;/code&gt; first evaluates &lt;code&gt;t + (4, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which yields &lt;code&gt;(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which is then assigned back to &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, thereby effectively &quot;modifying the contents&quot; of &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4. Built-in Types &amp;#8212; Python 3.6.3rc1 documentation|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple|website=python.org|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Python features ''sequence unpacking'' where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an ''iterable'' object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.{{citation-needed|date=October 2017}} 
* Python has a &quot;string format&quot; operator &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. This functions analogous to &lt;code&gt;[[printf]]&lt;/code&gt; format strings in [[C (programming language)|C]], e.g. &lt;code&gt;&quot;spam=%s eggs=%d&quot; % (&quot;blah&quot;, 2)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;&quot;spam=blah eggs=2&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the &lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; class, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&quot;spam={0} eggs={1}&quot;.format(&quot;blah&quot;, 2)&lt;/code&gt;, Python 3.6 added &quot;f-strings&quot;: &lt;code&gt;f'spam={&quot;blah&quot;} eggs={2}'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pep-0498&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation |url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/|website=python.org |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Python has various kinds of [[string literal]]s:
** Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in [[Unix shell]]s, [[Perl]] and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) as an [[escape character]]. [[String interpolation]] became available in Python 3.6 as &quot;formatted string literals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pep-0498&quot;/&gt;
** Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like [[here document]]s in shells, Perl and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].
** [[Raw string]] varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as [[regular expression]]s and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-style paths. Compare &quot;&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;-quoting&quot; in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* Python has [[array index]] and [[array slicing]] expressions on lists, denoted as &lt;code&gt;a[key]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a[start:stop]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;a[start:stop:step]&lt;/code&gt;. Indexes are [[zero-based]], and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the ''start'' index up to, but not including, the ''stop'' index. The third slice parameter, called ''step'' or ''stride'', allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example &lt;code&gt;a[:]&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a [[shallow copy]].

In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], or [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:

* [[List comprehensions]] vs. &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loops
* [[Conditional (programming)|Conditional]] expressions vs. &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; blocks
* The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; built-in functions (in Python 2, &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.

Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expressions]], all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as &lt;code&gt;a = 1&lt;/code&gt; cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for an equality operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; in conditions: &lt;code&gt;if (c = 1) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but &lt;code&gt;if c = 1: ...&lt;/code&gt; causes a syntax error in Python.

=== Methods ===
[[Method (programming)|Methods]] on objects are [[function (programming)|functions]] attached to the object's class; the syntax &lt;code&gt;instance.method(argument)&lt;/code&gt; is, for normal methods and functions, [[syntactic sugar]] for &lt;code&gt;Class.method(instance, argument)&lt;/code&gt;. Python methods have an explicit &lt;code&gt;[[this (computer programming)|self]]&lt;/code&gt; parameter to access [[instance data]], in contrast to the implicit &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Objective-C]], or [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-61&quot; /&gt;

=== Typing ===

Python uses [[duck typing]] and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at [[compile time]]; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being [[Type system#Dynamic type checking and runtime type information|dynamically typed]], Python is [[strongly typed programming language|strongly typed]], forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

Python allows programmers to define their own types using [[class (computer science)|classes]], which are most often used for [[object-oriented programming]]. New [[object (computer science)|instances]] of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, &lt;code&gt;SpamClass()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;EggsClass()&lt;/code&gt;), and the classes are instances of the [[metaclass]] &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; (itself an instance of itself), allowing [[metaprogramming]] and [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]].

Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: ''old-style'' and ''new-style''.&lt;ref name=&quot;classy&quot; /&gt; The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; and are instances of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.

The long term plan is to support [[gradual typing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/627418/ |title=Type hinting for Python |publisher=LWN.net |date=24 December 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named ''mypy'' supports compile-time type checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mypy-lang.org/ |title=mypy - Optional Static Typing for Python |publisher= |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Python has the usual C arithmetic operators (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). It also has &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; for exponentiation, e.g. &lt;code&gt;5**3 == 125&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9**0.5 == 3.0&lt;/code&gt;, and a new matrix multiply &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator is included in version 3.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |title=PEP 465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |work=python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has a unary operator (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;), which essentially inverts all the bytes of its one argument. For integers, this means &lt;code&gt;~x=-x-1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8305199/the-tilde-operator-in-python |title=The tilde operator in Python - Stackoverflow |work=stackoverflow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other operators include bitwise shift operators &lt;code&gt;x &lt;&lt; y&lt;/code&gt;, which shifts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the left &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; places, the same as &lt;code&gt;x*(2**y) &lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt; y&lt;/code&gt;, which shifts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the right &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; places, the same as &lt;code&gt;x/(2**y) &lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators |title=BitwiseOperators - Python Wiki |work=wiki.python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:&lt;ref name=&quot;pep0238&quot;/&gt;

* Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;7/3 == 2&lt;/code&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=&lt;code&gt;-7/3 == -2&lt;/code&gt;.}}
* Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. &lt;code&gt;7/3 == 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-7/3 == -3&lt;/code&gt;. The floor division &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; operator is introduced. So &lt;code&gt;7//3 == 2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-7//3 == -3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;7.5//3 == 2.0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-7.5//3 == -3.0&lt;/code&gt;. Adding &lt;code&gt;from __future__ import division&lt;/code&gt; causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).
* Python 3.0 changes &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; to be always floating-point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is ''classic division'', the version-3.0 &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; is ''real division'', and &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; is ''floor division''.

Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation &lt;code&gt;(a + b)//b == a//b + 1&lt;/code&gt; is always true. It also means that the equation &lt;code&gt;b*(a//b) + a%b == a&lt;/code&gt; is valid for both positive and negative values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of &lt;code&gt;a%b&lt;/code&gt; is, as expected, in the [[half-open interval]] [0, ''b''), where &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (''b'', 0] when &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-62&quot; /&gt;

Python provides a &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; function for [[rounding]] a float to the nearest integer. For [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie-breaking]], versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: &lt;code&gt;round(0.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 1.0, &lt;code&gt;round(-0.5)&lt;/code&gt; is -1.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-63&quot; /&gt; Python 3 uses [[round to even]]: &lt;code&gt;round(1.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 2, &lt;code&gt;round(2.5)&lt;/code&gt; is 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-64&quot; /&gt;

Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression &lt;code&gt;a &lt; b &lt; c&lt;/code&gt; tests whether &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate &lt;code&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-65&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}

Python has extensive built-in support for [[arbitrary precision arithmetic]]. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the python type &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, where needed. The latter have an &quot;L&quot; suffix in their textual representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Built-in Type|url = https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html|website = docs.python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In Python 3, the distinction between the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; class.) The &lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt; type/class in module &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt; (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PEP 0327 -- Decimal Data Type|url = https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0327/|website = Python.org|accessdate = 26 September 2015|last = Batista|first = Facundo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;Fraction&lt;/code&gt; type in module &lt;code&gt;fractions&lt;/code&gt; (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What's New in Python 2.6 -- Python v2.6.9 documentation|url = https://docs.python.org/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html|website = docs.python.org|accessdate = 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library [[NumPy]] that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.

== Libraries ==
Python has a large [[standard library]], commonly cited as one of Python's greatest strengths,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-86&quot; /&gt; providing tools suited to many tasks. This is deliberate and has been described as a &quot;batteries included&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot; /&gt; Python philosophy. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols (such as [[MIME]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]) are supported. Modules for creating [[graphical user interface]]s, connecting to [[relational database]]s, [[pseudorandom number generator|generating pseudorandom numbers]], arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-88&quot; /&gt; manipulating [[regular expression]]s, and doing [[unit testing]] are also included.

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the [[Web Server Gateway Interface]] (WSGI) implementation &lt;code&gt;wsgiref&lt;/code&gt; follows PEP 333&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-89&quot; /&gt;), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

{{As of|2017|09|post=,}} the [[Python Package Index]], the official repository containing third-party software for Python, contains over 117,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modulecounts.com/ |title=Module Counts |date=|website=ModuleCounts |publisher=|last1=Debill|first1=Erik |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; packages offering a wide range of functionality, including:

* Graphical user interfaces, web frameworks, multimedia, databases, networking 
* Test frameworks, automation and web scraping, documentation tools, system administration
* Scientific computing, text processing, image processing

== Development environments ==
{{See also|Comparison of integrated development environments#Python}}

Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a [[read-eval-print loop]] (REPL), meaning they can function as a [[command line interpreter]], for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately.

Other shells add abilities beyond those in the basic interpreter, including [[IDLE (Python)|IDLE]] and [[IPython]]. While generally following the visual style of the Python shell, they implement features like auto-completion, session state retention, and [[syntax highlighting]].

In addition to standard desktop [[integrated development environment]]s ([[Python IDE]]s), there are also [[web browser]]-based IDEs, [[SageMath]] (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs), and a browser-based IDE and hosting environment, [[PythonAnywhere]]. Additionally, the Canopy IDE is also an option for writing Python programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enthought|first1=Canopy |title=Canopy |url=https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/|website=www.enthought.com |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
{{See also|List of Python software#Python implementations}}

=== Reference implementation ===
The main Python implementation, named [[CPython]], is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], meeting the [[C89 (C version)|C89]] standard, with several select [[C99]] features.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-66&quot; /&gt; It compiles Python programs into intermediate [[bytecode]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-67&quot; /&gt; which is executed by the [[virtual machine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-68&quot; /&gt; CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python. It is available in versions for many platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and most modern [[Unix-like]] systems. CPython was intended from almost its very conception to be cross-platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-69&quot; /&gt;

=== Other implementations ===
[[PyPy]] is a fast, compliant&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-70&quot; /&gt; interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiler]] brings a significant speed improvement over CPython.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-71&quot; /&gt; A version taking advantage of [[multi-core processor]]s using [[software transactional memory]] is being created.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-72&quot; /&gt;

[[Stackless Python]] is a significant fork of CPython that implements [[microthread]]s; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-73&quot; /&gt;

[[MicroPython]] is a Python 3 variant that is optimised to run on [[microcontroller]]s.

=== No longer supported implementations ===
Other just-in-time compilers have been developed in the past, but are now unsupported:

* Google began a project named [[Unladen Swallow]] in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the [[LLVM]], and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-74&quot; /&gt;
* [[Psyco]] is a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] [[Run-time algorithm specialisation|specialising]] compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain [[data type]]s and is faster than standard Python code.

In 2005, [[Nokia]] released a Python interpreter for the [[Series 60]] mobile phones named [[PyS60]]. It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the [[Symbian]] operating system. This project has been kept up to date to run on all variants of the S60 platform and there are several third party modules available. The Nokia [[N900]] also supports Python with [[GTK]] widget libraries, with the feature that programs can be both written and run on the target device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Python on the Nokia N900 |url=http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/04/29/python-on-the-nokia-n900/|website=Stochastic Geometry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cross-compilers to other languages ===
There are several compilers to high-level [[object language]]s, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
* [[Jython]] compiles into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every [[Java virtual machine]] implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program.
* [[IronPython]] follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET [[Common Language Runtime]].
* The [[RPython]] language can be compiled to [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java bytecode]], or [[Common Intermediate Language]], and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.
* [[Pyjs]] compiles Python to [[JavaScript]].
* [[Cython]] compiles Python to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]].
* [[Pythran]] compiles Python to [[C++]].
* Somewhat dated [[Pyrex (programming language)|Pyrex]] (latest release in 2010) and [[Shed Skin]] (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.
* Google's [[Grumpy (compiler)|Grumpy]] compiles Python to [[Go (programming language)|Go]].
* Nuitka compiles Python into C++ &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nuitka.net/|title=Nuitka Home {{!}} Nuitka Home|website=nuitka.net|language=en|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===

A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Performance of Python runtimes on a non-numeric scientific code |last=Murri |first=Riccardo |conference=European Conference on Python in Science (EuroSciPy) |year=2013 |arxiv=1404.6388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Python's development is conducted largely through the ''Python Enhancement Proposal'' (PEP) process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python.&lt;ref name=&quot;PepCite000&quot; /&gt; Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's [[Benevolent Dictator For Life]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PepCite000&quot; /&gt;

Enhancement of the language goes along with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about the language's development; specific issues are discussed in the [[Roundup (issue tracker)|Roundup]] [[bug tracker]] maintained at python.org.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-21&quot; /&gt; Development took place on a [[self-hosted]] source code repository running [[Mercurial]], until Python moved to [[GitHub]] in January 2017.&lt;ref name=py_dev_guide&gt;{{cite web |title=Python Developer's Guide |url=https://docs.python.org/devguide/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:

* Backwards-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually [[ported]]. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently--for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.
* Major or &quot;feature&quot; releases, which are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. These releases are scheduled to occur roughly every 18 months, and each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.&lt;ref name=&quot;release-schedule&quot; /&gt;
* Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features but fix bugs. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-22&quot; /&gt;

Many [[beta release|alpha, beta, and release-candidates]] are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, this is often pushed back, if the code is not ready. The development team monitors the state of the code by running the large [[unit test]] suite during development, and using the [[BuildBot]] [[continuous integration]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-23&quot; /&gt;

The community of Python developers has also contributed over 86,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeBill|first1=Erik |title=Module Counts |url=http://www.modulecounts.com/#|website=www.modulecounts.com |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; software modules ({{as of|2016|08|20|lc=yes}}) to the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI), the official repository of third-party libraries for Python.

The major [[academic conference]] on Python is named [[PyCon]]. There are special mentoring programmes like the [[Pyladies]].

== Naming ==
Python's name is derived from the television series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-24&quot; /&gt; and it is common to use Monty Python references in example code.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutorial-chapter1&quot; /&gt; For example, the [[metasyntactic variable]]s often used in Python literature are [[Spam (Monty Python)|''spam'' and ''eggs'']], instead of the traditional [[foobar|''foo'' and ''bar'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;tutorial-chapter1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-26&quot; /&gt; Also, the official Python documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure Monty Python references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lutz |first1=Mark |title=Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming |year=2009 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn=9781449379322 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HxWGezDZcgC&amp;pg=PA17 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fehily |first1=Chris |title=Python |year=2002 |publisher=Peachpit Press |isbn=9780201748840 |page=xv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=carqdIdfVlYC&amp;pg=PR15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix ''Py-'' is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include [[Pygame]], a [[language binding|binding]] of [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] to Python (commonly used to create games); [[Python for S60]], an implementation for the [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] operating system; [[PyQt]] and [[PyGTK]], which bind [[Qt (software)|Qt]] and [[GTK]] to Python respectively; and [[PyPy]], a Python implementation originally written in Python.

== Uses ==
{{Main article|List of Python software}}
Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages as measured by the [[TIOBE Programming Community Index]]. {{as of|2017|3}}, it is the fifth most popular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ |title=TIOBE Index |publisher=TIOBE - The Software Quality Company |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked as Programming Language of the Year for the years 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-34&quot; /&gt; It is the third most popular language whose [[Syntax (programming languages)|grammatical syntax]] is not predominantly based on [[C (programming language)|C]], e.g. C++, Objective-C (note, C# and Java only have partial syntactic similarity to C, such as the use of curly braces, and are closer in similarity to each other than C).

An empirical study found that scripting languages (such as Python) are more productive than conventional languages (such as C and Java) for a programming problem involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary. Memory consumption was often &quot;better than Java and not much worse than C or C++&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-28&quot; /&gt;

Large organizations that make use of Python include [[Wikipedia]], [[Google]],&lt;ref name=&quot;quotes-about-python&quot; /&gt; [[Yahoo!]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-29&quot; /&gt; [[CERN]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-30&quot; /&gt; [[NASA]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-31&quot; /&gt; and some smaller entities like [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-32&quot; /&gt; and [[ITA Software|ITA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-33&quot; /&gt; The social news networking site [[Reddit]] is written entirely in Python.

Python can serve as a [[scripting language]] for [[web application]]s, e.g., via [[mod_wsgi]] for the [[Apache web server]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-35&quot; /&gt; With [[Web Server Gateway Interface]], a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. [[Web framework]]s like [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Pylons (web framework)|Pylons]], [[Pyramid (web framework)|Pyramid]], [[TurboGears]], [[web2py]], [[Tornado (web server)|Tornado]], [[Flask (web framework)|Flask]], [[Bottle (web framework)|Bottle]] and [[Zope]] support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. [[Pyjs]] and [[IronPython]] can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. [[SQLAlchemy]] can be used as [[Data mapper pattern|data mapper]] to a relational database. [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]] is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]].

Libraries such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]] and [[Matplotlib]] allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,&lt;ref name=&quot;cise&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliphant |first=Travis |title=Python for Scientific Computing |journal=Computing in Science and Engineering |year=2007 |url=https://www.h2desk.com/blog/python-scientific-computing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;millman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.

[[SageMath]] is a [[mathematical software]] with a &quot;[[Electronic Notebook|notebook]]&quot; programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of [[mathematics]], including [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]], [[numerical mathematics]], [[number theory]], and [[calculus]]. The Python language re-implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] platform is used for numeric and statistical calculations with 2D/3D visualization by the [[DataMelt|DMelt]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;schekanov&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chekanov |first=S. |date=April 2016 |title=Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform |url= https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319285290|location=London |publisher=Springer |page=670 |isbn=978-3-319-28531-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;schekanov2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chekanov |first=S. |date=2010 |title=Scientific Data Analysis using Jython Scripting and Java |url=https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319285290|location=London |publisher=Springer |page=600 |isbn=978-3-319-28531-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in [[finite element method]] software such as [[Abaqus]], 3D parametric modeler like [[FreeCAD]], 3D animation packages such as [[3ds Max]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Cinema 4D]], [[Lightwave]], [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[modo (software)|modo]], [[MotionBuilder]], [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage]], the visual effects compositor [[Nuke (software)|Nuke]], 2D imaging programs like [[GIMP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/faq.html |title=Installers for GIMP for Windows - Frequently Asked Questions |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |date=26 July 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inkscape]], [[Scribus]] and [[Paint Shop Pro]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-38&quot; /&gt; and [[musical notation]] programs like [[scorewriter]] and [[Capella (notation program)|capella]]. [[GNU Debugger]] uses Python as a [[Prettyprint|pretty printer]] to show complex structures such as C++ containers. [[Esri]] promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in [[ArcGIS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-39&quot; /&gt; It has also been used in several video games,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-40&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-41&quot; /&gt; and has been adopted as first of the three available [[programming language]]s in [[Google App Engine]], the other two being [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[Go (programming language)|Go]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-42&quot; /&gt; Python is also used in [[algorithmic trading]] and quantitative finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quantinsti.com/blog/python-best-programming-language-algorithmic-trading/ |title=Python - Best Programming Language for Algorithmic Trading Systems |date=9 March 2016|language=en-US|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quantinsti.com/blog/ibpy-tutorial-implement-python-interactive-brokers-api/ |title=Trading with Interactive Brokers using Python: An IBPy Tutorial |date=19 September 2016|language=en-US|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python has been used in [[artificial intelligence]] tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-43&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-44&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-45&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-46&quot; /&gt; As a scripting language with [[modular programming|modular architecture]], simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for [[natural language processing]] tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-47&quot; /&gt;

Many operating systems include Python as a standard component; the language ships with most [[Linux distribution]]s, [[AmigaOS 4]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] and [[macOS]], and can be used from the terminal. Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] uses the [[Ubiquity (software)|Ubiquity]] installer, while [[Red Hat Linux]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] use the [[Anaconda (installer)|Anaconda]] installer. [[Gentoo Linux]] uses Python in its [[package management system]], [[Portage (software)|Portage]].

Python has also seen extensive use in the [[information security]] industry, including in exploit development.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-49&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-50&quot; /&gt;

Most of the [[Sugar (software)|Sugar]] software for the [[One Laptop per Child]] XO, now developed at [[Sugar Labs]], is written in Python.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-51&quot; /&gt;

The [[Raspberry Pi]] [[single-board computer]] project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.

[[LibreOffice]] includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Python Scripting Provider is a core feature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4.0 New Features and Fixes |publisher=[[The Document Foundation]] |work=LibreOffice.org |year=2013 |url=http://www.libreoffice.org/download/4-0-new-features-and-fixes/ |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.

== Languages influenced by Python ==
Python's design and philosophy have influenced several programming languages, including:

* [[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. However, Boo uses [[static typing]] (and optional [[duck typing]]) and is closely integrated with the [[.NET Framework]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-90&quot; /&gt;
* [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]] uses indentation and a similar syntax. Cobra's &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-91&quot; /&gt; However, Cobra directly supports [[Design by contract|design-by-contract]], [[Unit testing|unit tests]], and optional [[static typing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-92&quot; /&gt;
* [[CoffeeScript]] is a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript; it has Python-inspired syntax.
* [[ECMAScript]] borrowed [[iterator]]s, [[generator (computer science)|generators]], and [[list comprehension]]s from Python.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-93&quot; /&gt;
* [[Go (programming language)|Go]] is described as incorporating the &quot;development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-94&quot; /&gt;
* [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-95&quot; /&gt;
* [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] was designed &quot;with [[hygienic macro|true macros]] [.. and to be] as usable for general programming as Python&lt;!--, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

(Did we mention it --&gt; [and] should be as fast as C&lt;!--?--&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref name=Julia&gt;{{cite web| title = Why We Created Julia| date= February 2012| website= Julia website| url= http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia| accessdate= 5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling to or from Julia is possible; to with [https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl PyCall.jl] and a Python package [https://github.com/JuliaLang/pyjulia pyjulia] allows calling, in the other direction, from Python.
* [[OCaml]] has an optional syntax, named twt (The Whitespace Thing), inspired by Python and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-96&quot; /&gt;
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]'s creator, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], has said: &quot;I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxdevcenter&quot; /&gt;
* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] is a programming language invented by Apple; it has some Python-inspired syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nondot.org/sabre |title=Chris Lattner's Homepage |publisher=Chris Lattner |first=Chris |last=Lattner |authorlink=Chris Lattner |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |quote=I started work on the Swift Programming Language in July of 2010. I implemented much of the basic language structure, with only a few people knowing of its existence. A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013 [...] drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. The practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python's case, a PEP) is also used in [[Tcl]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-99&quot; /&gt; and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-100&quot; /&gt; because of Python's influence.

Python has been awarded a TIOBE Programming Language of the Year award twice (in 2007 and 2010), which is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the course of a year, as measured by the [[TIOBE index]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoNT-101&quot; /&gt;

== Further reading ==
&lt;!-------- THIS IS *NOT* A LIST OF ALL PYTHON BOOKS
According to [[Wikipedia:Further reading]], criteria for inclusion includes:
1. Should clearly qualify as WP:RS, as indicated by reviews and citations to it.
...
5. There should be guidelines on limiting the number of sources.
6. To avoid spam, any book included should have received more than one good review in RS: newspapers and scholarly journals being the norm, and the clear balance of RS reviews should be positive. This would avoid self-publish spamming, POV pushing, and attempts by publishers to get books promoted through inclusion on Wikipedia. At the moment &quot;editorial recommendations&quot; as described in the manual smacks of OR.
7. Neutrality on the part of editors is essential. In terms of major debates, items representing all major positions should be included, with annotations indicating the specific POV of each. We may have to work out rules where topic disputes are irreconcilable.
