valid_out not sorted correctly

I looked at the valid_out for PA5 and it appears that words ship and shall are sorted incorrectly causing my code to not produce a matching output. Maybe I'm just going crazy, so someone else should double check. If this is indeed the case, I think the assignment may need to be regraded.
