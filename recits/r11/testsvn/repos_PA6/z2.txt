Yeah, mine was the same way not too long ago. It's probably not something to worry too much about right now; it looks like there's a whole lecture on efficiency the week after next. If you want a place to get started now though, definitely take advantage of callgrind, kcachegrind, and check out some of the data structures offered by the C++ standard library: here or here. Also, don't forget to implement best practices covered so far in lecture such as the use of const as well as references to avoid copying where appropriate. Best of luck!
